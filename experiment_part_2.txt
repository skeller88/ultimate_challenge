1. A key measure of success would be the median ratio, across all drivers who are reimbursed all toll costs, of rides given in Gotham to rides given in Ultimate. This would be known as the driver city ride ratio (DCRR). If the drivers are incentivized to drive in both cities, we would expect this metric to go up. This metric also makes it easy to compare different days of the week, and it handles a scenario in which partners change the city they drive in the most.

2. First, I'd understand the budget for this experiment in terms of free toll rides, and how many free toll rides the company could give. I'd also agree with stakeholders on a minimum detectable effect (MDE) in the ratio that would be needed to continue paying for free tolls. If Ultimate is a large service and even a small effect size (difference in results between the two datasets) turns out to be worthwhile to the business, then that means it could be worthwhile to run the experiment until a larger sample size is obtained that could detect this effect. On the other hand, if the MDE has to be fairly large, the sample size can be smaller.

The experiment would be an A/B test with create a control and experimental cohort of drivers. Cohorts would be balanced across driver engagement (active in the past few days vs. few weeks), driver demographics that are known to influence driver behavior, and any other relevant facets. For example, perhaps there are different cohorts of drivers that prefer to drive longer distances or shorter distances. The control group would get a simple encouragement to drive in both cities. The experimental cohort would be informed that their tolls will be reimbursed when traveling between cities.
